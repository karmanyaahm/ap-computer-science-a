# Arithmetic in Java Assignment e

What is the value of the variable on the left side after each individual line of
code is executed. Assume each line starts with the original values of the variables.
If the statement would result in a compiler error then write “compiler error.”

```java
int b = 5, c = 6, iResult;
double x = -1, y = 5, z = 0.5, dResult;
```

1. `iResult = x + y ;`
2. `dResult = c + b;`

3. `iResult = c/b;`
4. `dResult = c/b;`

5. dResult = (double)c/b;
6. dResult = (int)(c/b);
7. iResult = y * z;
8. iResult = (int)(y * z);

9. iResult = (int)y * (int)z
10. iResult = b - y;

11. dResult = b - z;
12. dResult = b - (int)z;

13. dResult = c * (int)z
14. x += 1;
