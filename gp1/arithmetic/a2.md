# Arithmetic in Java Assignment 2

What is the value of the variable on the left side after each individual line of
code is executed. Assume each line starts with the original values of the variables.

```java
int i = -1, b = 5, c = 6, iResult;  
double x = -1, y = 5, z = 0.5, dResult;
```

1. `iResult = c % 2;`
   - 0
2. `iResult = c % b;`
   - 1
3. `b += c;`
   - 11
4. `c /= 5;`
   - 1
5. `y++;`
   - 6.0
6. `i *= b * c;`
    - -30  
7. `dResult = y + y/z * x - y;`
   - -10.0
8. `y--;`
   - 4.0
9. `iResult = (3 * c) % (b * 2)`
    - 8
    - shouldn't there be a semicolon here?
10. `z -= 7 *x;`
     - 7.5
